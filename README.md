This assignment asks you to build a simple training‑center management system using object‑oriented programming in Python. You’ll define several classes—Course, Instructor, Student, and TrainingCenter—that represent courses, instructors, students, and the centre itself. Each class has appropriate attributes and methods: courses can hold topics, instructors can be assigned courses, students can enrol in courses and receive grades, and the training centre keeps track of its instructors and students. The goal is to practise designing classes, using instance and class attributes, writing methods, and making objects interact with each other.
